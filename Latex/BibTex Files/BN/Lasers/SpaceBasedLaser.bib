abstract = "Abstract This paper outlines the capabilities of a space-based laser for active debris removal in the range of 1 cm to 10 cm. As for respective ground based solutions, the space based laser ablates small bits of mass from the targeted debris objects. When directed properly, the resulting propulsive effect will lower the targets׳ perigees and facilitate an expeditious burnup in the Earth׳s atmosphere. For this particular type of space mission, a mission-specific performance model has been developed. It does not only deliver the removal performance (e.g. the number of objects removed) of a given mission scenario. It also provides insight into the relevant mechanisms that are driving the performance. The user can tell why a particular scenario is strong or weak, and iteratively tune the mission and the system parameters of the orbital debris sweeper. This parametric model allows case studies, parameter studies and optimizations of mission scenarios. As an illustration of the application of this model, a baseline mission scenario for a debris sweeper mission is being presented. Three system driver quantities for the overall mission concept are highlighted, and a reasonable parameter range for each of them is presented. Finally, it is shown how a single laser could already reduce the debris density in low Earth orbit (LEO) by more than 20% in 10 years. "
